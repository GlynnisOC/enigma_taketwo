# Enigma_1903
Final individual project for mod 1 promotion

Allows individuals to encode and decode messages with random 5-digit keys and the date to encode all your secret messages!


Based on the evaluation rubric, I'm still irritated by my performance. My tests are still relating to classes that have been
modified to modules. I know that with more time, I could fix them up, as well as have the command line interfaces up and running, but the functionality of the program is where I fell short the most. Therefore, I would award myself a 2 for functionality. Obviously, test driven development is another area that would receive a 2 for above-mentioned reasons. I am curious if the coverage still counts if you skip tests, as I am guessing not, but can never be sure! As far as objected-oriented programming and version control, I would award myself a 3 in both categories, as I believe I split up methods in different modules accordingly so that there were no lapses and I've gotten pretty comfortable with Github and manipulating the conversation between my local master and the 'true' master. While this is most important for working with groups and not on one own's project, it is still an important skill to master.

While I am not as thrilled with my performance on this project as I would like to be, I am very impressed with myself and my progress at Turing!
